# FrSB_KillFeed
 Custom killfeed cobbled together from old scripts as part of my Frankestein's SandBox system

Drag and drop the 'custom' folder into you root of your mission folder and repack your PBO

// Place this at the bottom of your init.sqf
[] execVM "custom\FrSBKillfeed\FrSBKillfeed.sqf";   // FrSB_Killfeed
